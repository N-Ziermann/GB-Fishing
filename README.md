![Alt text](Screenshot.png?raw=true "Title")
Gameboy fishing is a little high score fishing game written in C for the Nintendo Gameboy.
You can move your fishing rod up and down using the D-Pad.
The goal is to try and catch/touch as many fish as possible with the hook of your fishing rod, 
without touching any trash and to then bring them fish above the water, 
where you can store them using the A Button.
The game ends as soon as your hook touches any of the trash in the water.
